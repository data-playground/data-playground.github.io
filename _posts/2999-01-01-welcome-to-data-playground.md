# Hello everyone and welcome to Data Playground!

We are glad to present you this channel and website where we are going to have a lot of fun with data, analytics and automation topics and we hope you enjoy this adventure with us. My name is Pedro and I will guide you through this introduction of what to expect here at Data Playground.


## What is Data Playground?

Data Playground is a space to have fun with data. We want to share all aspects around an analysis including the gathering of data (from excel files to scraping off of websites), managing the data (storing and cleaning), analyzing and visualizing the results all the way to machine learning models and AI.

As our name states, at Data Playground we intend to have fun with our discoveries. We will definitely work on the basics of our analysis, where we understand the data we are dealing with, but we are also going to move away from the common place and have some fun while exploring new insights the data can provide us.


## Playing Instructions

The idea is to have a fun environment to explore all the facets of data. Feel free to explore alongside us and find your own adventure as we go through the posts.

Every post will be accompanied by the scripts, databases, dashboards and anything else that may help us enjoy the process. Any and all material will be avaialble and should have its own comments and guide on how to create your own version.

## Playing Tools

There are many tools out there capable of performing each of the steps and through our quests we may use different tools depending on the situation but, in most cases, we are going to give preference to free (specially open source) tools, where you could not only follow the process, but actually perform alongside us.

Each time you see a tool being mentioned, you will be able to follow instructions on how to access an install the tool used. So be ready for those hyperlinks.

To see every tool used in the Playground, visit the [Programs](https://data-playground.github.io/programs/) page. This page is a live document that will be updated as we keep playing with new tool along the way.


## Playing Content

We will have fun with a variety of topics, each with their own specifities. Some topics you will see here include, sports, music, movies and TV, cooking, video games and much more.

Strap in and prepare for a lot fun, coding, math (I know, fun, fun and more fun). Hope you enjoy and welcome to Data Playground.
