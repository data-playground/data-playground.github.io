# Hello everyone and welcome to Data Playground!

We are glad to present you this channel and website where we are going to have a lot of fun with data, analytics and automation topics and we hope you enjoy this adventure with us. My name is Pedro and I will guide you through this introduction of what to expect here at Data Playground.

## What is Data Playground?

Data Playground is a space to have fun with data. We want to show all aspects around an analysis including the gathering of data (from excel files to scraping off of websites), managing the data (storing and cleaning), analyzing and visualizing the results.

As our name states, at Data Playground we intend to have fun with our discoveries. We will definitely work on the basics of our analysis, where we understand the data we are dealing with, but we are also going to move away from the common place and have some fun while exploring new insigths the data can provide us.

## Playing Instructions

As mentioned above, we intend to walk through all the steps from getting the data to presenting the results. There are many tools out there capable of performing each of the steps and through our quests we may use different tools depending on the situation but, in most cases, we are going to give preference to free (specially open source) tools, where you could not only follow the process, but actually perform alongside us.

In the next couple of weeks we will walk you through the installation of the preferred tools that you will see being used most of the time.
