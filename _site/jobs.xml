        <explanation>This remote Python Staff Software Engineer role aligns with the candidate&apos;s extensive Python development for automation and data processing, especially with cloud environments like GCP and containerization. Their 10+ years of experience would match the &apos;Staff&apos; level.</explanation>
        <qualification_analysis>The candidate&apos;s proficiency in Python for scripting, automation, and data pipelines is a core strength. Their experience with BigQuery and other GCP services, as well as building full-stack applications (Django), demonstrates their capability in cloud-native development. Although not explicitly &apos;Staff&apos; level, their 10+ years of overall experience aligns well with the expectation for experienced professionals.</qualification_analysis>
        <skill_gaps>Specific mentions of &apos;OpenStack&apos; or &apos;AWS&apos; are less prominent than GCP in the resume, though the candidate has general cloud experience. Explicit experience with &apos;CI/CD workflows, with proficiency in Kafka for real-time data streaming&apos; is a specific gap, though Airflow for orchestration is present.</skill_gaps>
