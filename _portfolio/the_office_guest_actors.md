One of the most historic comedy TV shows ever, "The Office" was a career starter (or at least launcher) for basically every one of its main actors. But it also had it own batch of actors that had smaller parts or appeared in an episode that enjoyed other works with the show's main actors.

For this dashboard, I looked through each credited actor on "The Office" and compared their work with that of the main actors (to be considered a main actor, the character must have appeared on at least 100 episodes, following the typical syndication rules).

Going from names like Ken Jeong that only appeared in one episode in the series, all the way to David Koechner and Amy Ryan that (in different formats) had their own arch in this historical show, we can see how these actors' careers are intertwined, not only through 9 seasons of "The Office", but through throughout Hollywood's history.
