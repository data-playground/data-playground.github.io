To celebrate one of the biggest competitions in the world, I went through the history of the FIFA World Cup through the kicks and headers of the goals scored in the competition.

In the Tableau dashboard, I tell the history of this almost 100-year old competition, showing the goal distribution per year, by minute of gameplay, passing through which countries scored and were scored against, highlighting the goalscorers, their positions and even the jersey number they were wearing when scoring.

This travel through football history is a great way to remember and praise this sport's most waited and celebrated competition
